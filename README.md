# C Stress Test

A single-file, self-contained stress test for C compilers and optimizers.

This is an amalgamated/simplified version of the LangArena benchmark
(https://github.com/kostya/LangArena) for the C language.

LangArena: A collection of 50 tasks across 24 languages - complex,
non-synthetic, and inspired by real-world problems (JSON, Base64, CSV,
neural networks, compression, maze A*, graph algorithms, sorting, hashing,
interpreters, parallel matmul, and more).

Fully "all in" - it has no external dependencies beyond the standard
libraries. That is, this file is completely self-contained and can be used
as a stress test for C compilers on its own, as well as for the optimizer.

Build:

    gcc -Wno-format index.c -O3 -lm -o ./index
    ./index

It also includes the config directly in this file.

All parameters have been tuned so that each test runs for roughly 1 second
on my machine. That is, the total time is approximately 50 seconds (but
results may differ on other hardware).
